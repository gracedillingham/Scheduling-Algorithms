# Scheduling-Algorithms

This program is designed to compare the average wait time of two scheduling algorithms on the same data set. The first algorithm used is the Round Robin Scheduling algorithm, which works by allowing each process to run in turns for a set amount of time until each is complete. The second, more efficient algorithm used is a Priority Scheduling algorithm. This particular algorithm works by assigning a priority to each process, and completely executing each process in this set order.
